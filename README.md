#  Defect Detection in Manufacturing Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning

This repository contains the code, models, and documentation for my **Industry Internship Project** completed at **Proglint's Software Solutions** as part of the **Industry Internship Programme (IIP) - XXI 700** in Semester VI of the **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (AIML)** 

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a real-time defect detection system in manufacturing using an ensemble of **YOLOv8, CNN, and EfficientNet**. It aims to improve defect detection accuracy by combining localization and classification models in a modular and scalable pipeline.

### 🔧 Defects Detected:
- Dent  
- Scratch  
- Corner Defect  
- Spidol Mark

The system also classifies defects by **severity level**: Minor, Moderate, Severe.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a real-time, automated defect detection pipeline.
- Use ensemble modeling to reduce false positives/negatives.
- Perform classification with severity categorization.
- Enable scalable deployment in smart manufacturing environments.
- Train and test using a custom industrial dataset.

## 🧪 Methodology

### Pipeline Architecture:

1. **Detection** → YOLOv8 detects ROIs.
2. **Classification** → CNN and EfficientNet classify the cropped ROI.
3. **Fusion** → Weighted averaging based on model confidence.
4. **Severity Scoring** → Minor (0.0–0.5), Moderate (0.5–0.8), Severe (0.8–1.0).
5. **Visualization** → Color-coded bounding boxes.
